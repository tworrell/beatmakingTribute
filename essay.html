    <h3>Black Beatmaking</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Black Beatmaking is an underground culture like no other. It's actually happens to be a community i'm lucky enough to be apart of. The community heralds some of the best black beatmakers to grace their sound with our ears. One of the best being JDilla (who unfortunately passed away in 2006). </p>
    <br>
    <p>When it comes to beatmaking it usually entails you(the beatmaker/producer) coming up with a beat from scratch or flipping(remixing) an already on the market song. The song featured on this page would be an exaple of a flip. What makes this so different is because most of the time these songs are recorded while the beatmaker is "jamming out" on their synthesizer of choice(Most of the time the SP404). The producer usually makes the song with an assortment of samples that were pre-recorded. They will wlso throw in a few effects to the different sounds of the project.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What makes this community so unique. Is most of these beatmakers can replicate or create entirely new beats on the spot. People tend to get beatmakers and DJs mixed up. Even though a beatmaker can be a DJ their form of performance differs. Djs mix songs together live, while beatmakers mix sounds (particulary loops, smaples and effects)together live, which would in turn create a full song.</p>
